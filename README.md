### ---- How to Fork&Clone the Repo ----

---

> 1 On the GitHub page for this repository, click on the button "Fork".
>
> 2 Clone your forked repository to your computer with SSH so you don't use your pass all the time.
>> For example, run this command inside your terminal:
>> git clone git@github.com:<your-github-username>/midlands-bg-school.git
>> Replace <your-github-username>!

> 3 Move to project directory.
>> cd <project/directory>
> 4 Before you make any changes, keep your fork in sync to avoid merge conflicts.
>> git remote add upstream git@github.com:TheVanguardOfCode/midlands-bg-school.git  --> run it only once
>> git pull upstream main

> 5 After adding the upstream and checking that all files are up to date, we now will create new branch before editing any files. There are two ways to do so:

>> 5.1 --> git checkout -b <branch-name>

>> 5.2 --> git branch <branch-name>
>>         git switch <branch-name>

> 6 On your computer, open your text editor, and add your name to the README.md file.
>> -[@M<your-github-username>](https://github.com/<your-github-username>/)

> 7 Add the changes with git add, git commit (write a good commit message, if possible).

>> git add README.md
>> git commit -m "your-message>"

> 8 Push your changes to your repository.
>> git push origin <branch-name>

> 9 Go to the GitHub page of your fork, and make a pull request.
